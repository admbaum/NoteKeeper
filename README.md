PluralSight Notekeeper tutorial app updated to use ViewBindings

# DISCLAIMER:
This code is to help people taking the "Android Apps with Kotlin: Build Your First App" course on Pluralsight.  I'm assuming that there might be some copyright issues,
but make no mistake, this code is from a tutorial on Pluralsight with full credit given to Jim Wilson, the instructor for the course.

Jim et al..., if you read this by chance, I updated your example code as open source.  If there are any issues with this, I will remove this intellectual property immediately.
